**Katherine Halama** is the Education Program Coordinator for Earth Lab, working with the Earth Analytics Education Team by coordinating with various CU departments and students for the Earth Data Analytics Professional Certificate and the ESIIL Stars program (formerly Earth Lab's Earth Data Science Corps). She's excited to help students enter the field of earth data science and contribute meaningful change.

Before joining Earth Lab, Katherine worked at the North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center and graduated from CU Boulder with a degree in Environmental Studies. Katherine is passionate about natural resource management and environmental policy. Outside of work, Katherine loves to backpack, ski, travel, and write for her photojournalism blog.

I'm excited to learn basic data science skills, and how they can help me make meaningful change as an environmental scientist! I would like to use earth data science to help me understand how snowpack levels in the West are changing and how that impacts water supply in the Colorado River Basin. Here is an example question:
**How does snowpack in the Colorado River Basin effect water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead?**

Fun fact! I've rafted the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon four times and caught (and released :D) hundreds of humpback chub (an endangered fish species in the Grand Canyon!)
